"""
Repository Package (Data Access Layer).

This package contains repository classes responsible for abstracting data
persistence operations. Repositories provide a clean API for the service
layer to interact with the database (e.g., create, read, update, delete records)
without exposing database-specific implementation details.

Modules:
- chat_repository.py: Implements data access logic for chat completions
  and messages, interacting with the configured database.
