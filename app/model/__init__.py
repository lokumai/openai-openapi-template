"""
Data Model Package.

This package defines Pydantic models that represent the structure of data
as it is stored in the database or used internally within the application's
business logic. These models are distinct from API schemas and are primarily
used for database interaction and internal data representation.

Modules:
- chat_model.py: Defines models for chat completions and messages,
                 including fields for database storage and audit trails.
